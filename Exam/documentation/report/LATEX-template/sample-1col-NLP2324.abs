This paper presents two studies on conversational toxicity. The first study investigates toxic conversation detection using simple Machine Learning models. The second study describes a novel BERT-based system for real-time toxic conversation tagging and recognition through fine-tuning, which also performs personality classification in dialogues, incorporating zero-shot learning and fine-tuning approaches. Both studies yielded excellent results, with the proposed methodologies achieving significant performance in their respective tasks and demonstrating the effectiveness of context-aware processing in conversational AI applications.
